              I enjoy a variety of activities, including climbing and aerial
              hoop. From my young age I participated in various sport
              competitions like running, climbing and cross-country skiing. My
              parents always led me to sports and we did them together.

              . I have been climbing for 4 years now and I even persuaded my dad
              to climb with me. I enjoy climbing very much and I am even a
              little bit stronger which is a positive thing about it.

              I do Arial Hoop at home. I have been doing Arial Hoop since I was
              13 years old. At first I did it with my friend from school at an
              afternoon club but now I have an aerial hoop at home and I train
              at home. I do this sport just for fun and it&apos;s mostly just
              doing some new skills on the hoop.
